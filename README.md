## Technical Challenges 

* I spent around 3 hours trying to implement the draggable background image in my game. Initially, 
I wanted to get the styles of my component using refs, but found that they didn't clunked up 
my code with the need for a forced update, various TS errors, and the unknown inability to get
updated styles. I found a workaround after a bit of messing around by using the good old 
e.currentTarget, using window.getComputedStyle to get relevant style information, while 
using .style to write style changes.
